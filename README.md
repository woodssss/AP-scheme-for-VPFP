# Introduction
This project provides part of code for paper [VARIATIONAL-ASYMPTOTIC-PRESERVING-SCHEME-FORVLASOV-POISSON-FOKKER-PLANCK-SYSTEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01969). Include 1D,2D,3D spatially homogeneous case and 1D spatailly inhomogeneous case. For collision term, JKO scheme is considered, and MUSCL is applied to the advection term. Line search technique is used in solving JKO scheme and superlinear convergence rate is observed(by output t_k and will see t_k=1 gradually). Asymptotic presrving property can be verified by recording and comparing results of different magnitude of \varepsilon.
